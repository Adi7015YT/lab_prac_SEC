## Introduction

This LaTeX template was designed for documenting lab experiments, reports, or assignments. It uses the `fancyhdr` package for custom headers and footers and `lipsum` for placeholder text, which can easily be replaced with your actual experiment data.

## Features

- **Customizable Headers and Footers**: Includes document title in the header and institution name in the footer.
- **Sectioned Content**: Easily divide your document into sections for each lab experiment or topic.
- **Automatic Page Numbers**: Page numbers are automatically included in the footer.
- **Placeholder Text**: The template uses `lipsum` for placeholder text, which can be replaced with actual lab content.
  
## Requirements

- [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/get/) distribution installed on your machine.
- Any LaTeX editor, such as:
  - [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/)
  - [TeXShop](https://pages.uoregon.edu/koch/texshop/texshop.html) (Mac)
  - [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/) (Windows/Linux)
